## This is my notes markdown file!

- whenever creating an object except for strings and arrays, you must use new
- Date dt; declaration
- dt = new Date(); intialization

- overriding the equals method in custom classes is quite common in order to check internal variables of both objects you are comparing (position, move, piece,board)

- if you want to usee static methods with in a static object create an instance of it
- always make instance variables private, make get/set methods public, the protected method is so subclasses can get
    - getters and setters can be autogenerated by IDE after internal variables written
